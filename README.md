# Offensive language identification using BERT
#### This project involved identifying offensive language in social media posts using the BERT model. The task was framed as a text classification problem where the model categorizes each post as either offensive or non-offensive.

#### Offensive language identification is crucial for moderating online platforms. BERT, a transformer-based model, leverages contextual embeddings, making it highly effective for tasks like this, where context plays a significant role in understanding meaning. 

#### I fine-tuned the pre-trained BERT model on an offensive language dataset, handling tasks like text preprocessing, removing stopwords, tokenization, and model evaluation. My contribution involved training the model, optimizing hyperparameters, and ensuring good performance with appropriate evaluation metrics. This project enhanced my skills in working with advanced transformer-based models and deep learning techniques for NLP.
